First released in [1985](#) as an extension of [C](#), it has expanded significantly over time; as of [1997](#), C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.

Fun fact: C++ was originally named ["C with Classes"](#) in [1979](#)! The name C++ was coined in [1983](#), with ["++"](#) being the increment operator in C, suggesting it's an enhanced version of C:

\`\`\`cpp
int c = 5;
c++;  // Now c is 6, hence C++ is "better" than C!
\`\`\`

It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including [GCC](#), [LLVM/Clang](#), [Microsoft Visual C++](#), [Intel](#), and [IBM](#). The latest standard, [C++23](#), was approved in [2023](#).

[C++](#) powers some of the world's most performance-critical software including [Adobe Photoshop](#), [MySQL](#), [MongoDB](#), and most [AAA game engines](#) like [Unreal Engine](#). Here's a taste of modern [C++20](#):

\`\`\`cpp

It's fascinating that despite being over [35 years old](#), C++ remains one of the [top 5 most popular programming languages](#), proving that raw performance and control still matter in modern computing.`,logo:e.Cpp,name:"C++",category:"pro-lang"}),a({slug:"csharp",color:"purple",description:`[C#](#) (pronounced "See sharp") is a general-purpose, high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. Designed by [Anders Hejlsberg](#) (who also created [Turbo Pascal](#) and led the [TypeScript](#) project) from [Microsoft](#) in [2000](#) and later approved as an international standard by [Ecma (ECMA-334)](#) in [2002](#) and [ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270)](#) in [2003](#).

[Microsoft](#) introduced C# along with [.NET Framework](#) and [Visual Studio](#), both of which were initially closed-source. Four years later, in [2004](#), a free and open-source project called [Mono](#) began, providing a cross-platform compiler. A decade later, Microsoft released [Visual Studio Code](#), [Roslyn](#) (compiler), and the unified [.NET platform](#), all supporting C# as free, open-source, and cross-platform tools.

Fun fact: The ["#"](#) in C# represents four ["+"](#) symbols in a 2x2 grid, suggesting C# is ["C++++"](#)! Here's some modern C# with top-level statements:

\`\`\`csharp

It was created by the [OpenGL ARB](#) ([OpenGL Architecture Review Board](#)) to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use [ARB assembly language](#) or hardware-specific languages. Released in [2004](#) with [OpenGL 2.0](#), GLSL revolutionized real-time graphics programming.

Here's what makes GLSL powerful: it runs directly on your [GPU](#), meaning these programs (called ["shaders"](#)) execute in parallel across thousands of cores simultaneously - that's why your games can render millions of pixels at [60+ FPS](#)! GLSL shaders come in different types: [vertex shaders](#) (process each vertex), [fragment shaders](#) (process each pixel), [geometry shaders](#) (create new geometry on the fly), [tessellation shaders](#), and [compute shaders](#) (general-purpose GPU computing).

Here's a simple fragment shader creating a gradient:

\`\`\`glsl
#version 330 core
out vec4 FragColor;
in vec2 TexCoord;

void main() {
    // Create a colorful gradient based on position
    vec3 color = vec3(

They're used to create advanced lighting effects (realistic [shadows](#), [reflections](#), [ambient occlusion](#)), complex materials ([subsurface scattering](#) for skin, [anisotropic surfaces](#) like brushed metal), post-processing effects ([bloom](#), [motion blur](#), [depth of field](#)), and procedural textures (noise, patterns generated mathematically). Fun fact: [ShaderToy](#), a website where people share GLSL shaders, has some mind-blowing creations - entire [3D scenes](#), [ray-traced graphics](#), and simulations running in just fragment shaders!

Created in [1993](#) by [Roberto Ierusalimschy](#), [Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo](#), and [Waldemar Celes](#) at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro](#) in [Brazil](#). Fun origin story: Lua was created due to Brazil's strict [trade barriers for computer hardware and software](#) in the [early 1990s](#), forcing developers to create their own solutions! The language was influenced by [SOL](#) ([Simple Object Language](#)) and [DEL](#) ([data-entry language](#)).

Here's Lua's elegant table syntax and metatable magic:

Lua is remarkably small - the entire interpreter is only about [280KB](#)! Despite its tiny size, Lua powers massive games: [World of Warcraft](#) uses Lua for all its [UI and add-ons](#) ([millions of lines of Lua code](#)!), [Roblox](#) uses [Luau](#) (their Lua variant) with over [70 million games](#) created, [Angry Birds](#), [CryEngine](#), [Garry's Mod](#), and countless others. Fun fact: Lua's indexing starts at [1, not 0](#) like most languages - this quirk drives programmers nuts but makes sense for non-programmers! [Lua 5.4](#) is the latest version ([2020](#)). It's one of the [fastest interpreted languages](#), perfect for game scripting where performance matters!`,logo:e.Lua,name:"Lua",category:"pro-lang"}),a({slug:"python",color:"yellow",description:`[Python](#) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.

Here's mind-blowing: There are approximately [2 billion websites](#), and [100% of them](#) use HTML! HTML is celebrating over [30 years](#) as the backbone of the web. Fun trivia: The first image ever uploaded to the web was a compressed [JPEG](#) of the CERN house band ["Les Horribles Cernettes"](#) in [1992](#). HTML is so fundamental that it's often the first language aspiring developers learn!`,logo:e.HTML,name:"HTML",category:"markup-style"}),a({slug:"css",color:"blue",description:`[Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](#) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in [HTML](#) or [XML](#). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. First proposed by [Håkon Wium Lie](#) (a Norwegian web pioneer) in [1994](#) while working at [CERN](#) with [Tim Berners-Lee](#), CSS was born from necessity - early websites mixed structure and styling in HTML, creating maintenance nightmares! [CSS1](#) was released in [1996](#), [CSS2](#) in [1998](#), and [CSS3](#) development began in [1999](#) but is still ongoing (CSS is now modular with independent specifications). Here's the fascinating part: The ["Cascading"](#) in CSS refers to the algorithm that determines which style rules apply when multiple rules target the same element - specificity wars are real!

[CSS](#) enables the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. [CSS3](#) introduced game-changing features: [animations and transitions](#) (no more JavaScript for simple animations!), [flexbox](#) (finally, vertical centering is easy!), [grid layout](#) (2D layouts without hacks!), [custom properties/variables](#) (--my-color: #ff0000), [media queries](#) for responsive design, and so much more.

Here's modern CSS in action:

\`\`\`css
/* Flexbox - vertical centering made easy! */
.container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

/* CSS Grid - powerful 2D layouts */
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    gap: 20px;
}

/* Custom properties and animations */
:root {
    --primary-color: #3b82f6;
}

.button {
    background: var(--primary-color);
    transition: transform 0.3s;
}

.button:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
}
\`\`\`

Fun fact: The ["float"](#) property was originally designed for wrapping text around images, but for years it was (ab)used for layouts until [flexbox](#) and [grid](#) saved us all! CSS has become incredibly powerful - you can create entire games, art, and animations purely with CSS. The website [csszengarden.com](#) demonstrates how the same HTML can look completely different with just CSS changes!`,logo:e.CSS,name:"CSS",category:"markup-style"}),a({slug:"js",color:"yellow",description:`[JavaScript (JS)](#) is a lightweight, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as [Node.js](#), [Apache CouchDB](#), and [Adobe Acrobat](#). JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

Here's a wild fact: JavaScript was created by [Brendan Eich](#) in just [10 days](#) in May [1995](#) while working at [Netscape](#)! Originally named ["Mocha"](#), then ["LiveScript"](#), it was renamed ["JavaScript"](#) as a marketing move to ride on Java's popularity, despite having almost nothing in common with Java.

That's impressive and all, but you know what's also impressive? Shooting yourself in the foot while writing some code with this language:

\`\`\`javascript
'11' + 1;  // '111' - fair enough, string concatenation!
'11' - 1;  // 10 - why???
\`\`\`

JavaScript has evolved dramatically with modern frameworks like [React](#), [Vue](#), [Angular](#), [Svelte](#), and [Solid](#). The ecosystem has grown from simple DOM manipulation to full-stack development with [Node.js](#), mobile apps via [React Native](#), and desktop applications using [Electron](#). The [ECMAScript](#) standard ([ES2024](#) is the latest) continues to add powerful features like async/await, modules, optional chaining, and more.

Despite its quirks and the infamous ["JavaScript fatigue"](#), it remains the most widely-used programming language, with [98% of websites](#) using it. Fun fact: [V8](#), Chrome's JavaScript engine, compiles JS to machine code for blazing-fast performance, and powers [Node.js](#), [Deno](#), and [Bun](#) runtimes!`,logo:e.JavaScript,name:"JavaScript",category:"pro-lang"}),a({slug:"blender",color:"orange",description:`[Blender](#) is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software tool set used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D-printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games. Originally developed in [1995](#) by Dutch animation studio [NeoGeo](#) (not the gaming company!) as an in-house tool, Blender's story took a dramatic turn in [2002](#). When NeoGeo went bankrupt, the community rallied together and raised [€100,000](#) in just [seven weeks](#) to buy the rights and release it as open-source - one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns before crowdfunding was even a thing!

Blender features [modeling](#), [sculpting](#), [texturing](#), [rigging](#), [animation](#), [simulation](#) (fluid, smoke, particles), [rendering](#) ([Cycles](#) and [Eevee](#) real-time engine), [compositing](#), [motion tracking](#), and [video editing](#) - all in one package! Here's the kicker: Blender is completely [FREE](#), yet rivals [$3,000+ software](#) like [Maya](#) and [3ds Max](#).

It's used in major productions including [Spider-Man 2](#), [Next Gen](#) ([Netflix](#)), and [Man in the High Castle](#). [Blender 4.0](#) ([2023](#)) marked a milestone with [real-time compositing](#). The [Blender Foundation](#) produces stunning open movies like ["Spring"](#) and ["Coffee Run"](#) to showcase capabilities and fund development. With over [20 million downloads](#), Blender proves that quality software doesn't need a price tag!`,logo:e.Blender,name:"Blender",category:"design"}),a({slug:"zbrush",color:"orange",description:`[ZBrush](#) is a digital sculpting tool that combines [3D/2.5D modeling](#), texturing, and painting. Developed by [Pixologic](#) (now part of [Maxon](#) since [2021](#)), ZBrush was first released in [1999](#) and revolutionized digital sculpting forever. Here's what makes ZBrush absolutely insane: it uses proprietary ["pixol"](#) technology that stores lighting, color, material, orientation, and depth information for rendered points, allowing artists to work with models containing [hundreds of millions of polygons](#) in real-time on standard hardware - something that would crash other 3D software instantly!

ZBrush was the first software to popularize digital sculpting, and its influence is so profound that ["ZBrushing"](#) has become a verb in the 3D art community. Fun fact: ZBrush started as a [2.5D painting program](#) before evolving into the 3D sculpting powerhouse it is today! Features like [DynaMesh](#) (dynamic tessellation), [ZRemesher](#) (automatic retopology), and countless specialized brushes make it unmatched for organic modeling.

ZBrush has been used to create characters and creatures for nearly every major film and AAA game in the last two decades - from [Gollum](#) in [Lord of the Rings](#) to every [Marvel superhero](#), from [God of War](#) to [The Last of Us](#). [ZBrush 2024](#) introduced new features with [AI-assisted sculpting](#) tools. Artists can sculpt models with over [1 billion polygons](#)!`,logo:e.ZBrush,name:"ZBrush",category:"design"}),a({slug:"houdini",color:"orange",description:`[Houdini](#) is a 3D animation and visual effects software developed by [SideFX](#), based in [Toronto, Canada](#). First released in [1996](#), Houdini is built on a completely [procedural, node-based workflow](#) that distinguishes it from every other 3D software - and here's why that's revolutionary: change one parameter at the beginning of your workflow, and everything updates automatically! No more starting from scratch when clients request changes. This procedural approach, while having a steeper learning curve, provides unprecedented flexibility in creating and modifying complex effects and animations.

Houdini is particularly renowned for its mind-blowing dynamics and simulation tools for creating [destruction](#) (buildings exploding, bridges collapsing), [fluids](#) (realistic water, lava, liquid simulations), [fire and smoke](#) ([FLIP fluids](#) and [Pyro FX](#)), [particles](#) (millions of them), and [cloth](#). Fun fact: Houdini is named after [Harry Houdini](#), the famous escape artist, because it helps VFX artists "escape" from difficult effects challenges!

The software features the [VEX scripting language](#) (similar to C) for creating custom tools and effects, [Houdini Engine](#) for integrating procedural workflows into [Maya](#), [3ds Max](#), [Unity](#), and [Unreal Engine](#), and [Solaris](#) for [USD-based](#) workflows. Houdini has been used in basically every major VFX film: [Frozen's](#) snow, [Moana's](#) ocean, [Dune's](#) sandworms, and [The Matrix Resurrections](#). The [Apprentice version](#) is free for non-commercial use! [Houdini 20](#) ([2024](#)) introduced new [machine learning](#) features and enhanced performance.`,logo:e.Houdini,name:"Houdini",category:"design"}),a({slug:"speedtree",color:"green",description:`[SpeedTree](#) is a vegetation modeling and middleware software developed and sold by [Interactive Data Visualization, Inc. (IDV)](#), founded by [Chris King](#) and [Greg King](#). First released in [2002](#), SpeedTree solved one of game development's most tedious problems: creating realistic trees and vegetation. Before SpeedTree, artists had to model every tree by hand - imagine modeling a forest of [10,000 unique trees](#)! SpeedTree uses [procedural generation](#) to create trees, plants, and grass with realistic growth patterns, branching algorithms based on [real botany](#), [wind animation](#) (trees that realistically sway and react to wind!), and [seasonal variations](#) (watch your trees change from spring blooms to autumn colors).

Fun fact: The name ["SpeedTree"](#) comes from its original purpose - rapidly generating trees for real-time applications! The software features [hand-drawing tools](#) for artistic control, [photogrammetry import](#) (scan real trees!), [physics-based wind](#) effects with frequency and amplitude control, [LOD (Level of Detail)](#) generation for performance optimization, and models optimized for real-time rendering. SpeedTree integrates seamlessly with [Unity](#), [Unreal Engine](#), [CryEngine](#), [Lumberyard](#), and custom engines.

Here's mind-blowing: SpeedTree has been used in [Avatar](#) (those alien trees!), [The Witcher 3](#), [Red Dead Redemption 2](#), [Horizon Zero Dawn](#), [God of War](#), and practically every major game with vegetation. It's also used in films like [The Jungle Book](#) and architectural visualizations. [SpeedTree Cinema](#) (for VFX) and [SpeedTree Games](#) handle different needs.

First released in [1997](#) (as [Visual Studio 97](#)), it unified Microsoft's various development tools ([Visual Basic](#), [Visual C++](#), [Visual J++](#), [Visual FoxPro](#]) into a single environment - revolutionary at the time! Visual Studio supports development for various platforms including [Windows](#), web, mobile, cloud, [Xbox](#), and more. It includes powerful code editors, debuggers (with features like [Edit and Continue](#) - modify code while debugging!), visual designers for UI, database tools, and extensive profiling and diagnostic tools.

Visual Studio features [IntelliSense](#) (Microsoft's intelligent code completion that debuted here in [1996](#)), advanced debugging ([breakpoints](#), [watch windows](#), [immediate window](#), [historical debugging with IntelliTrace](#)), built-in [Git](#) support, [extensions marketplace](#) with thousands of add-ons, and deep integration with [Azure](#) services. Fun fact: [Visual Studio 2022](#) was the first [64-bit version](#), meaning it can finally use more than [4GB of RAM](#) - huge for large solutions! It supports languages including [C++](#), [C#](#), [Visual Basic](#), [F#](#), [Python](#), [JavaScript](#), [TypeScript](#), and more.

Visual Studio comes in different flavors: [Community](#) (free!), [Professional](#), and [Enterprise](#). The ["VS"](#) abbreviation is so iconic that Microsoft named their code editor [VS Code](#).

Released in [2015](#) at Microsoft's [Build conference](#), VS Code went from zero to hero in record time, becoming the most popular developer tool within just [2 years](#)! Here's something surprising: Microsoft, historically known for proprietary software, made VS Code completely [open-source](#) ([MIT license](#)) and cross-platform from day one. Built on the [Electron framework](#) (also used by [Slack](#), [Discord](#), and [Atom](#)), it runs on [Windows](#), [macOS](#), and [Linux](#).

VS Code features [IntelliSense](#) (smart code completion that actually feels intelligent), [debugging support](#) for dozens of languages, integrated [Git](#), syntax highlighting, customizable themes, and an integrated terminal. But here's where it gets crazy: VS Code's [extension marketplace](#) has over [50,000 extensions](#), and developers have downloaded them billions of times! The editor supports virtually every programming language through extensions and features [remote development](#) capabilities (code on a server from your laptop), [Live Share](#) for real-time collaboration (Google Docs for code!), and [GitHub Copilot](#) integration for AI-assisted coding.

Fun stats: Over [14 million developers](#) use VS Code monthly, making it the [#1 developer tool](#) in [Stack Overflow surveys](#) since [2018](#). The VS Code team ships updates [monthly](#) with new features.

First released in [2017](#) after a [2-year](#) public preview, Rider brought JetBrains' powerful code analysis and refactoring tools to a standalone .NET IDE. Here's what makes Rider special: it combines the best of both worlds - IntelliJ Platform's robust IDE features with ReSharper's deep .NET code analysis (over [2500+ code inspections](#)!). Rider supports [.NET Framework](#), [.NET Core](#), [Xamarin](#), [Unity](#) (with dedicated Unity support!), [ASP.NET](#), and more on [Windows](#), [macOS](#), and [Linux](#). Fun fact: Before Rider, .NET developers on Mac and Linux were severely limited - Rider changed that completely!

The IDE features advanced code analysis and quick-fixes (often suggesting fixes before you even realize there's a problem), powerful refactoring tools inherited from [ReSharper](#) ([rename](#), [extract method](#), [change signature](#) - all working flawlessly), a fast [debugger](#) with advanced features, built-in [Unity support](#) with debugging, profiling, and shader support, [SQL and database tools](#), [VCS integration](#) ([Git](#), [SVN](#), [Mercurial](#)), and extensive language support including [C#](#), [VB.NET](#), [F#](#), [JavaScript](#), [TypeScript](#), [HTML](#), [CSS](#), and more.
